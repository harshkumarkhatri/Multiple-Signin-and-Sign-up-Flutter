# firebase_signup_login

This is an register and login app which i made in flutter
<br>
**About the app**:-<br>
When you open the app you will have two raised buttons on the first screen which will take you to the respective screens.
<br>
When you click on the signup button it will take you to a signup screen where you have to enter your email, password, and confirm the password. If the account is not already existing with those credentials then a new account will be created and a message saying "Registration successful you can bow login will be displayed" but if the account is already existing then you will have a message saying "Error registering".<br>
Now once you have an account you have to click on the back button and go to the login page where you will be having two options to login with. One is the credentials that you registered recently and the other is through Gmail id i.e. google login. When you log in with the credentials you will be taken to the home screen saying "You are in" but when you log in with the google option you will be taken to the same homepage which will be displaying your name attached with your Gmail account. When you log in with the google option the next time you will be coming to this app and clicking on the google option then you do not need to select the id and it will auto-login you with the similar id you logged in with earlier.
